# Font Veil
Font Veil is a short python script that takes in a normal font and outputs a blank font with the same width and kerning for each letter. You can hide portions of text by applying your blank font, while retaining the overall layout of the text.

# Setup
`sudo apt-get install python-fontforge`

# Roadmap
## Version 2.0
* Let users specify their input font at runtime, rather than in the code.
* Let users specify their output font file at runtime, rather than in the code.

# Developed By
